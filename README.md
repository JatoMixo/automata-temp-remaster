# Water Heater Automata (Temporary Remaster)
This is a remaster for my water heater automata, that takes the chapest electricity hours
for the day and only turns it on when we're in one of them.

The API I used 2 years ago was deprecated, so I made some quick changes to use the one
by the Spanish Electrical Network, which won't be deprecated from one day to another.
